(124, 'Endometriosis is a hormonal disease associated with inflammation. Despite this, the mechanisms by which endometrial cells interact remain poorly understood. It is recognized that endometriotic lesions bleed and undergo repeated injury and repair. Recent studies have shown that the immune system is involved in the progression and scarring of endometriotic lesions, with platelets and regulatory T cells playing a crucial role. Using mouse models, researchers have found that depleting these cells can slow the progression and scarring of lesions. This depletion disrupts the type 2 immune response in the lesions, resulting in decreased cell aggregation and slower progression. These findings suggest that platelets and Tregs contribute to promoting a type 2 immune environment that facilitates the progression and scarring of endometriotic lesions.#Endometriosis is a hormonal disease characterized by inflammation. Despite its prevalence, there is limited understanding of the interplay between cell types involved. Endometriotic lesions, which are prone to bleeding and injury, are repaired repeatedly. Studies using mouse models have revealed the involvement of platelets and regulatory T cells in the immune response, and their depletion has been found to impede the progression and scarring of these lesions.
